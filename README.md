**ProgressPulse** is a web-based application developed as a part of **Naan Mudhalvan** course curriculum. The motto of the product is "**Beyond the scope of academic evaluation**". Our product evaluates the student not only using academic evaluation as a parameter, but also we have considered parameters which are crucial factors for the holistic outcome of the student. This product is intended for students pursuing their under-graduation, who are in their Sophomore, Pre-Final and Final year of their graduation. Our product also provides feedback to the student with the help of **Interfaceless API**, in order to reflect upon their progress and to enlighten their academic journey. I would like to extend my gratitudde to **Naan Mudhalvan team** and **HCLTech** for providing us this opportunity to develop the project.  Also I am grateful to the student community who have taken the initiative to share their valuable data.

**Note Points** : 
1. The score of improvement might be possessing an error of 2.15 due to lack of response.
2. The text-based response might possess other special charecters since the API which is linked to the Transformer model is being trained on the data previously provided in the website.
